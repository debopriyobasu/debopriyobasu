# Debopriyo Basu

Senior Backend Engineer with experience owning and modernizing backend systems.

I primarily work with **Java, Spring Boot, and Google Cloud Platform**, and have led an end-to-end migration of a legacy J2EE monolith to a Spring Boot microservice, improving deployment cadence and operational clarity. My work focuses on backend ownership, system design, API contracts, and production deployments on Kubernetes.

Earlier in my career, I worked on frontend systems, which gives me strong product context, but my current focus is backend systems and reliability.

## Areas of Focus
- Backend system ownership
- Monolith to microservice migrations
- REST API design and service boundaries
- Cloud-native deployments on GCP
- Pragmatic architectural trade-offs
